This its a simple test where you have to do the following tasks:

there should be a function findValues( new int[] {1,3,5,7,9}, 9 ) 

that function should return this index array [1, 3, 0] 

this index array follows the folloging logic,
it looks for three values that calculated are equal to the number selected

in this particular example it would be (3 + 7 - 1) = 9.
